# My Learning Journey ðŸš€

A collection of everything Iâ€™m learning â€” from C++ algorithms and data structures to Python, cryptography, and data science.

## ðŸ“˜ Structure
- **cpp/** â†’ Algorithms, data structures, and college practicals  
- **python/** â†’ Cryptography, scientific computation, and data science work

## ðŸ§  Goals
- Build solid foundations in C++, Python, and data science
- Keep improving every day
- Track my progress publicly

## ðŸ›  Tools
- **Python** â†’ VS Code  
- **C++** â†’ Dev C++  
- **GitHub** â†’ To store my messy progress neatly
